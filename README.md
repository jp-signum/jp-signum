I work at the intersection of climate, machine learning, and public-interest technology — building geospatial and environmental data systems that strengthen data integrity, accessibility, and scientific transparency. My work spans atmospheric ML, environmental monitoring, GIS data engineering, and resilient data workflows for climate research and civic-tech organizations.
