Extensive experience in the education technology sector and my passion for teaching others computer science has shaped my career. I transitioned into the climate technology and sustainability sector in 2023, focusing on machine learning and data science consulting through my company [NetZeroDev](https://netzerodev.earth/). I also mentor early-stage startups throughout the climate space. I am culminating my experiences building custom LMS, teaching CS, and passion for fighting climate change into a university that upskill senior engineers looking to transition into climate tech. I am a fervent wildlife conservationist and believe we can make a difference in fighting climate change, bringing a more equitable future for all.

I hold a B.S. in Biochemistry from Syracuse University and am a native English speaker. I just started my journey of learning Japanese and plan also to learn ASL and Gaelic. I am a licensed private career school teacher in computer programming through the New York State Education Department and a certified APMG university instructor in cybersecurity through ISACA. I am an avid music collector, skier, golfer, and tennis player currently residing in Brooklyn, NY.
