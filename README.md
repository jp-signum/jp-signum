With extensive experience in the education technology sector, I have built my career around a passion for teaching computer science. As a fervent wildlife conservationist, I believe in the power of technology to combat climate change and promote a more equitable future for all. I exist at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and climate science. Focusing on causes and organizations that aim to make a difference.

I hold a B.S. in Biochemistry from Syracuse University and am a native English speaker. I'm learning Japanese and plan to study American Sign Language and Gaelic. I am a licensed private career school teacher in computer programming through the New York State Education Department and a certified APMG university instructor in cybersecurity through ISACA. I enjoy collecting music, skiing, golfing, and playing tennis, and I currently reside in Brooklyn, NY.
